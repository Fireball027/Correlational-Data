# Correlational Data Project

## Overview

Welcome to the **Correlational Data** project! This Python-based data analysis project investigates relationships between variables in datasets. It focuses on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing correlations, offering insights into how different factors interact with each other. The included example examines correlations in a movie dataset.

---

## Key Features

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between numerical variables.
- **Data Visualization**: Uses heatmaps and scatter plots to present correlations.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to new datasets.
- **Actionable Insights**: Helps uncover patterns and trends in data.

## Project Files

### 1. `main.py`
This is the main script responsible for performing correlation analysis and generating visualizations.

#### Key Components:
- **Data Loading**:
  - Reads data from a CSV file (e.g., `movies.csv`).
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handles missing values and ensures data integrity.
- **Correlation Calculation**:
  - Computes pairwise correlations between numerical variables.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generates heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize relationships.

#### Example Code:
```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
data = pd.read_csv('movies.csv')

# Calculate correlations
correlation_matrix = data.corr()

# Visualize correlations
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Heatmap')
plt.show()
```

### 2. `movies.csv`
This dataset contains information about movies, including:
- **Title**: Name of the movie.
- **Budget**: Production budget.
- **Revenue**: Box office earnings.
- **Rating**: Audience ratings.
- **Duration**: Runtime in minutes.

Ensure the dataset is in the same directory as the script or provide the correct file path in `main.py`.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure the required libraries are installed. If not, run:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

### Step 2: Execute the Script
Run the `main.py` script:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View Results
- A **correlation heatmap** will be displayed, showing relationships between variables.
- Scatter plots (if implemented) will offer deeper insights into specific variable pairs.

## Insights from the Movie Dataset

- **Budget vs. Revenue**: Positive correlation, indicating that higher budgets tend to result in higher earnings.
- **Rating vs. Duration**: Weak or no correlation, suggesting movie length doesnâ€™t strongly influence audience ratings.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Multiple Datasets**: Add support for analyzing multiple datasets at once.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Use tools like Streamlit for dynamic visualization.
- **Advanced Statistical Tests**: Incorporate hypothesis testing for deeper analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement predictive models based on correlated variables.

## Conclusion
The **Correlational Data** project is a powerful tool for understanding relationships between variables. With its clear visualizations and robust analysis, it provides valuable insights that can guide data-driven decision-making.

Feel free to explore, extend, and adapt this project to suit your analytical needs!
